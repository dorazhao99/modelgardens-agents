class ExtractProjectResourcesSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """
Extract the **project resources** visible in the user’s current context and scratchpad.  

Your goal is to identify **files, folders, repositories, documents, or collaborators** that are *actually visible or referenced* in the current view.  
Each resource should include:
- a **name** (short label),  
- a **description** (optional, summarizing what it is or why it matters),  
- and a **resource identifier** such as a URL, file path, folder path, repository name, or collaborator email.

========================
Rules
========================
- Do **not** invent or speculate about unseen resources.  
- If nothing relevant is visible, return `NULL` or state that no resources were found.  
- Prefer high-level, persistent entities (repositories, shared docs, project folders) over ephemeral ones (temporary files, single lines).  

========================
How to Think Hierarchically
========================
- In a **code editor**, identify the repository or root project folder first.  
  - Then list notable files or directories underneath it.  
- In **cloud-based tools** (e.g., Google Docs, Overleaf, Notion), record:  
  - The document or workspace title,  
  - Its shareable link (if visible),  
  - And any collaborator names or emails shown in the interface or comment threads.  
  - People leaving comments, edits, or suggestions are likely collaborators — record them.  
- In **communication or coordination views**, list shared workspaces or people explicitly involved.

========================
Heuristic Questions
========================
Ask yourself:
- What would another person need to locate or resume this project later?  
- Which entities define *where*, *in what medium*, and *with whom* the work is happening?

========================
Special Emphasis
========================
If the context resembles a workspace or editor:
- Always capture the repository, folder, or workspace name (shown in the title bar or root path).  
- Then include relevant files, cloud documents, and collaborators.  
- Repository, document, and collaborator identifiers are *critical* for long-term traceability.

class EditProjectScratchpadSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """
Edit the project scratchpad based on new information.  
The scratchpad is an ongoing, structured log of the user’s progress and context for this project.

========================
Guidelines by Section
========================
- **Ongoing Objectives** → Goals currently being worked on. Add only when there is clear evidence of active progress.  
- **Completed Objectives** → Tasks that appear finished or replaced. Move them here when appropriate.  
- **Suggestions** → Helpful ideas, tools, or workflow improvements worth trying later.  
- **Notes** → Observations, context, or clarifications that help interpret other sections.  
- **Project Resources** → Tangible items such as Files, Repos, Folders, Core Collaborators, or Other.  
  - This section is *critical* for reconstructing the project later.  
  - Include repository names, file paths, collaborator emails, or shared doc links when visible.  
  - Prefer higher-level resources over small files. Mark uncertain URIs as guesses.  
- **Next Steps** → Specific, *constructive*, and *autonomously actionable* tasks that a background agent could complete or prepare without explicit approval.  
  - These should never commit the user socially (e.g., no scheduling meetings or sending messages), but they **should** take creative, technical, or organizational initiative.  
  - Great next steps are the ones that save future effort or push the project meaningfully forward — not just clerical tasks.  
  - Examples of strong next steps include:  
    - “Refactor `data_loader.py` to reduce startup latency by caching preprocessed inputs.”  
    - “Turn the recent model-comparison results into a one-slide summary for tomorrow’s check-in.”  
    - “Write a concise README section explaining how to reproduce the latest experiment.”  
    - “Add an evaluation script to benchmark response time across different models.”  
    - “Integrate the new paper citations into `related_work.tex`.”  
    - “Create a quick plot comparing the last three experiment runs in `results.csv`.”  
    - “Summarize insights from yesterday’s discussion into a ‘Future Work’ paragraph.”  
    - “Identify which dataset subsets contribute most to variance in the current metric.”  
    - “Outline a short plan for automating the recurring data-upload process.”  
  - Focus on steps that increase clarity, reduce friction, or meaningfully advance the research or engineering process — ideally things that a human would appreciate having ‘already done.’

========================
Confidence Management
========================
- Every entry should include a **confidence score** from 0–10.  
- **Start low (1–3)** when adding new items — this reflects an initial observation.  
- If you later see the same fact or behavior again, **update confidence upward** (e.g., 5–7).  
- Only mark high confidence (8–10) when a pattern has been repeatedly confirmed.  
- This gradual reinforcement helps the agent learn which propositions are stable.

========================
General Guidance
========================
- Keep entries concise and avoid duplicates.  
- Aim for diversity across sections when updating.  
- If no new information is available, it’s fine to only add a short Note.  
- Move outdated or finished Ongoing Objectives to Completed Objectives as evidence builds.  
- **Add only one proposition per edit call.** For multiple changes, call the tools separately.  

========================
When Adding Project Resources
========================
- Prioritize high-level, persistent entities (repos, docs, folders, collaborators).  
- Include links (URLs, file paths, or emails) when known.  
- Never fabricate URIs — explicitly note if uncertain.
