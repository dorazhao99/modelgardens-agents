MCP server: coder

Exposes one tool `run_code_task(project_name, task)` that mirrors the old CodeAgent:
  • Renders the project's scratchpad (no project_context arg needed).
  • Uses your existing repo-finding stack (dspy Identify/Select + find_folders).
  • Runs OpenHands headlessly to complete the task and create a PR.
  • Summarizes the trajectory (short + long) via a DSPy call.
  • Logs a concise artifact line in the scratchpad with hidden metadata.

Keep docstrings exactly as authored; DSPy/tool callers rely on them.

    Trigger the coding agent to implement a code change and open a PR.

    NOTE: All coding related tasks should be handled by this tool.  This is a highly capable and specialized agent that is capable of handling a wide range of coding tasks.

    The tool will:
      1) Render the project's scratchpad to provide broader context.
      2) Identify the likely project repository and resolve it to a concrete path.
      3) Run OpenHands (Coding Agent) headlessly to make a branch, edit, commit, push, and open a PR.
      4) Read the **true contents** of the OpenHands trajectory file and summarize it via
         a DSPy call into:
         • short_summary: a single sentence, layperson-friendly description of what was achieved
         • full_summary: a step-by-step summary of what the agent accomplished
      5) Record a concise artifact entry in the scratchpad under
         "Agent Completed Tasks (Pending Review)" with hidden metadata that
         stores the long summary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_name : str
        The Precursor project name.
    task : str
        A concrete coding task for the repository.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A concise human-readable status message including the PR URL (if any),
        the one-sentence short summary, and a reminder:
        **do not resubmit the artifact if it was already recorded successfully.**
