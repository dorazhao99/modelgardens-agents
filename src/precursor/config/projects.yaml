# This file defines the projects that the MCP-enabled agent is allowed to
# operate on.
#
# Each project:
#   name:           (required) unique project name; this is what tools/agent use
#   description:    (optional) short human or model-readable explanation of what
#                   the project is about. The scratchpad renderer will display
#                   this directly under the project title if present.
#   agent_enabled:  (optional, bool) whether background/auto agents are allowed
#                   to operate on this project. Defaults to true if omitted.
#
# You can safely add more projects here; the scratchpad/store layer will
# validate against this list.
