"""
ProjectTransitionObserver

This observer is for the *departure* case:

- user was on PROJECT_A for a good stretch
- then user switched to PROJECT_B
- → we trigger background work for PROJECT_A (the one we just left)

Key detail (to match tests):
We measure the duration of the segment we just left as:
    duration = (start of CURRENT segment) - (start of PREVIOUS segment)

i.e. "we were on Alpha from when we first saw Alpha until we started Beta".
