Okay clearly the specs are missing a lot of important details!!! Can you please update the feature.md specs for:
- logging format and placement when verbose=True.
- feature6: Clarified ShortenInstruction must output proposed_instruction with prefix PROPOSED INSTRUCTION:, post-processing order, and no LM kwarg mutation.

```Based on the provided images, here’s a detailed description of the actions occurring across the images:

- **Environment Setup**:
  - The user is working in a coding environment, likely using a version control system, specifically Git, to manage their code changes. This is evident from the terminal commands shown in the terminal pane.

- **File Navigation**:
  - The user is navigating through a project directory named `CodeConflictBenchmark`, which contains multiple folders (e.g., `feature1`, `feature2`, etc.) and script files (e.g., `run_tests.sh`, `setup.sh`).

- **Script Execution**:
  - In the terminal, the user attempts to execute `git pull`, which is a command used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into the local branch. The terminal output indicates that there is a problem merging with a specific reference from the remote repository (`michael-dspy-fix`).

- **Patch Application**:
  - The prompt in the `run_tests.sh` file shows a conditional statement that checks for the existence of the variable `$FEATURE_PATCH` and attempts to apply a patch if it’s present. If successful, a message confirming the patch application is echoed.

- **Version Handling**:
  - The script also checks for the Python version in the virtual environment, trying to use Python 3.10 if available, and falling back on Python 3.12 if not. Warnings are displayed when no suitable Python version is found.

- **Content Updates**:
  - The `Files updated` section shows that several feature markdown files have been updated, which may relate to the user's development work.

- **Continuing Interaction**:
  - In the latter images, the user types commands in the terminal, indicating ongoing interaction with the repository, possibly following up on the previous commands or further debugging.

Overall, the images illustrate the user's engagement in managing a coding project while utilizing Git and scripts for setup and patching processes.",Michael Ryan,"I am a CS PhD student (NLP) at Stanford.  
I work across several concurrent research projects.
I am interested in building personalized LLM tooling.

Right now coding agents work mostly independently (such as when you prompt it to take action), but we forsee a future where you deploy several parallel coding agents and they need to communicate plans and intent with one another.  I am helping with adding some eval tasks to this research project that test modifying the DSPy repo.  I am also observing some of these agent trajectories and identifying their failures.

Right now coding agents work mostly independently (such as when you prompt it to take action), but we forsee a future where you deploy several parallel coding agents and they need to communicate plans and intent with one another.  I am helping with adding some eval tasks to this research project that test modifying the DSPy repo.  I am also observing some of these agent trajectories and identifying their failures.

```The series of images depict a user engaged in a coding environment, particularly using a terminal with a focus on managing a software project. Here’s a concise breakdown of the actions and context:

- **Directory Navigation & File Management**:
  - The user is working within a directory titled `CodeConflictBenchmark`, containing multiple folders and files such as `.github`, `.venv`, and various `feature` folders.
  - The terminal shows various commands being executed, specifically a `git pull`, indicating the user is trying to synchronize their local repository with a remote one.

- **Attempting to Pull Changes**:
  - The command `git pull` is executed, but an error message is displayed: ""Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref `refs/heads/michael-dspy`, but no such ref was fetched.""
  - This suggests that while the user is trying to update their local files, there's a mismatch or issue with the branch being accessed.

- **Running Shell Scripts**:
  - The shell script `run_tests.sh` is being executed, which contains Python version checks and commands to set up a virtual environment.
  - The script attempts to apply a patch file when certain conditions are met, indicating potential modifications to the project’s working files.

- **Editing and Collaboration**:
  - The right-hand panel shows detailed feedback on specific code features and necessary modifications, likely for collaboration purposes. The user is expected to clarify specs and adhere to certain instructions regarding logging formats and feature implementations.

- **Contextual Updates**:
  - A message related to updating project specifications is visible, along with file updates enumerated from the `datasest/dspy_task/task8635/feature` directory, reflecting ongoing collaboration or review tasks.

- **Exploring Project’s Documentation**:
  - In a later image, the user is viewing a `README.md` file, which likely contains project documentation and instructions on starting the development server. Actions like running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` suggest preparation for project setup.

These actions indicate that the user is involved in both coding and collaboration efforts, addressing issues in version control, and engaging with project documentation and specifications.",Michael Ryan,"I am a CS PhD student (NLP) at Stanford.

Right now coding agents work mostly independently (such as when you prompt it to take action), but we forsee a future where you deploy several parallel coding agents and they need to communicate plans and intent with one another.  I am helping with adding some eval tasks to this research project that test modifying the DSPy repo.  I am also observing some of these agent trajectories and identifying their failures.

Seamful XAI: Operationalizing Seamful Design in Explainable AI
Mistakes in AI systems are inevitable, arising from both technical limitations and sociotechnical gaps. While black-boxing AI systems can make the user experience seamless, hiding the seams risks disempowering users to mitigate fallouts from AI mistakes. Instead of hiding these AI imperfections, can we leverage them to help the user? While Explainable AI (XAI) has predominantly tackled algorithmic opaqueness, we propose that seamful design can foster AI explainability by revealing and leveraging sociotechnical and infrastructural mismatches. We introduce the concept of Seamful XAI by (1) conceptually transferring “seams” to the AI context and (2) developing a design process that helps stakeh... Show more

Overall, these actions depict a workflow that combines coding, troubleshooting, and collaborative discussions in a tech-focused setting.",Michael Ryan,"I am a CS PhD student (NLP) at Stanford.  
I work across several concurrent research projects.
I am interested in building personalized LLM tooling.
","I am interested in an agent that can help organize my work.
I would especially like an agent that keeps track of progress and if I have a meeting coming up for a particular project it can compile my results into slides or a report.
I also think an agent that finds related work and performs background literature review would be helpful.
Feedback on my writing is another welcome form of assistance.
I don't mind for the agent to be creative about other forms of assistance!!","Current Time: 2025-11-18 12:41 PST
