Agents that observe the user's work and when the user is idle or working on a separate project, they will automatically perform background tasks to help the user.  Name may be changed to 'Precursor'

## Ongoing Objectives
[0] Fix induce_and_log signature and immediate bugs — Correct the induce_and_log method signature (avoid using 'str' as a parameter name), accept/rename parameters like screenshot_path, ensure local variables used in the function (e.g., v, res, user_name) are defined and not shadowing built-ins, make the return value consistent with the declared type (e.g., return res.goals, res.reasoning), and add defensive checks and clear logging around CSV writes (verify timestamp, screenshot_path, and JSON-serializable fields before writer.writerow). (confidence: 7)

## Completed Objectives
None

## Suggestions
None

## Notes
[0] Terminal shows logger.py actively processing the observation queue — e.g., 'Started batcher with 82 items in queue' and multiple 'Processing item ...' / 'Added observation ...' log lines are visible in the terminal. This indicates the logging/queue system is running and recent changes to objective_inducer.py are being executed during dev runs. (useful for debugging and reproducing CSV/serialization issues). (confidence: 8)

## Project Resources
### Files
[0] dev/survey/objective_inducer.py — Python file open in VS Code defining ObjectiveInducer and the induce_and_log method; contains JSON-safe serialization and CSV logging logic (visible in editor and terminal). (confidence: 8)
[1] dev/survey/logger.py — Logger script that processes the observation queue/batcher and invokes objective_inducer; visible in the VS Code sidebar and confirmed active by terminal output showing `python logger.py` (useful for reproducing end-to-end logging behavior). (confidence: 9)
[2] dev/survey/context_log.csv — CSV log file visible in the VS Code explorer; likely the target for CSV writes from logger/objective_inducer and useful for inspecting serialized rows and reproducing CSV-related bugs. (confidence: 8)
[3] dev/survey/screenshots/screenshot_20251016_173805.png — Screenshot image open in the editor showing the VS Code workspace and terminal output; useful for reproducing the exact UI state and debugging layout/console evidence visible during the recent edits. (confidence: 8)

### Repos
[0] BACKGROUND-AGENTS — VS Code workspace / repository (workspace name visible in the window title and Explorer). Serves as the top-level repo for the dev/survey code and related logging utilities. (confidence: 8)

### Folders

### Other

## Next Steps
[0] Write automated tests for serialization and end-to-end logging — create unit tests for the _to_plain (or equivalent) helper to ensure it converts complex objects (Proposition, Pydantic models, nested dicts/lists) into JSON-native structures; add an integration test that runs induce_and_log against a temporary CSV path (or tempdir) and asserts the CSV row exists and that fields like user_details, calendar_events, and goals parse as JSON (no nested JSON strings). Put tests under tests/, e.g. tests/test_serialization.py and tests/test_integration_logger.py, and include helpers to read/parse the CSV rows. This will make it easy to run locally and add to CI later. (confidence: 6)
[1] Implement a CSV-safe writer helper (e.g., `safe_csv_write`) — create a small helper (place in dev/survey/logger_utils.py or in objective_inducer.py) that: (confidence: 6)
[2] converts complex fields with `_to_plain` and calls `json.dumps` exactly once per complex field (user_details, calendar_events, goals); (confidence: 6)
[3] validates all row values are strings/JSON-serializable before calling `writer.writerow`; (confidence: 6)
[4] wraps serialization and writer calls in try/except, logs exceptions with context, and on failure writes the problematic payload to a separate debug file (e.g., context_log_badrows.jsonl) for offline inspection; (confidence: 6)
[5] add a unit test for the helper that simulates a non-serializable object and verifies the bad-row file is created and the exception is logged. This will reduce CSV corruption and make failures diagnosable. (confidence: 6)

## Ongoing Objectives
[0] Add step-based UI and breadcrumbs for Demo page — implement a stepper/breadcrumb navigation with screens: Info, Upload, Process, Review. Ensure navigation can move forward and back, preserve appropriate downstream state when navigating back, and reset downstream state when a new upload occurs. Integrate the visual breadcrumb/step indicator into src/app/demo/page.tsx and wire up controls to switch screens. (confidence: 7)
[1] Wire CSV upload to parsing and Review table — connect a file input to the existing parseCsv implementation in src/app/demo/page.tsx; parse uploaded CSVs robustly (handle quoted fields and embedded newlines), render parsed rows in a Review table with basic validation and the ability to edit/confirm rows, display parse error messages on failure, and keep parsed data in component state so Process and Review screens can access it. (confidence: 7)
[2] Resolve git repository error and enable commits — diagnose why the working directory reports 'not a git repository' (wrong working directory, missing .git, or broken worktree). Actions: check current path vs repo root, look for .git folder, attempt recovery steps (cd to project root, git init or git remote add, or restore .git from another clone), and verify git status, commit, and push work. (evidence: terminal shows git error in VS Code) (confidence: 6)

Integrate the visual breadcrumb/step indicator into src/app/demo/page.tsx and wire up controls to switch screens. (confidence: 7)
[1] Wire CSV upload to parsing and Review table — connect a file input to the existing parseCsv implementation in src/app/demo/page.tsx; parse uploaded CSVs robustly (handle quoted fields and embedded newlines), render parsed rows in a Review table with basic validation and the ability to edit/confirm rows, display parse error messages on failure, and keep parsed data in component state so Process and Review screens can access it. (confidence: 7)
[2] Resolve git repository error and enable commits — diagnose why the working directory reports 'not a git repository' (wrong working directory, missing .git, or broken worktree). Actions: check current path vs repo root, look for .git folder, attempt recovery steps (cd to project root, git init or git remote add, or restore .git from another clone), and verify git status, commit, and push work. (evidence: terminal shows git error in VS Code) (confidence: 6)
[3] Validate and clean uploaded CSV before processing — detect missing or malformed values in uploaded CSVs (e.g., blank rating cells visible in the Review table), implement a column-confirmation / mapping UI, add basic validation rules and helpful error messages, and provide simple in-app fixes (fill, drop, or annotate rows). Ensure cleaned/validated data is saved into page-level state (or context) so the Process step uses the corrected dataset. (confidence: 5)

## Completed Objectives
None

## Suggestions
None

## Notes
[0] Review table in the demo shows missing/blank rating cells in multiple rows after upload (visible in rows 0–4). The UI pagination displays ""Showing 1 to 5 of 21 entries"", indicating the uploaded CSV contains 21 rows. This supports adding validation/cleaning work for incomplete ratings. (confidence: 6)

## Project Resources
### Files
[0] src/app/demo/page.tsx — Demo page React/Next.js component currently open in the editor; main locus for adding step-based UI, breadcrumb navigation, and CSV upload/Review screens. (uri: src/app/demo/page.tsx) (confidence: 8)
[1] package.json — Node project manifest visible in the project tree; contains dependencies and npm scripts for building/running the demo. (uri: package.json) (confidence: 8)
[2] src/app/demo/layout.tsx — Layout file for the demo page; likely contains shared layout (header/footer, containers) and is a good place to host the Stepper/Breadcrumb wrapper. (uri: src/app/demo/layout.tsx) (confidence: 7)
[3] eval_metrics_CoGymTravelOutcome_outcomeRating_42.csv — CSV file observed uploaded into the AutoMetrics demo (visible in the browser/file picker and Review table in screenshots). Possible uri/filename: eval_metrics_CoGymTravelOutcome_outcomeRating_42.csv (path uncertain). (confidence: 3)
[4] screenshot_20251016_174427.png — Screenshot referenced in context_log/Numbers showing the AutoMetrics demo upload/review state. Path shown in Numbers: /Users/michaelryan/Documents/School/Stanford/Research/background-agents/dev/survey/screenshots/screenshot_20251016_174427.png (confidence: path may vary). (confidence: 4)
[5] context_log.numbers (Numbers document 'context_log') — Spreadsheet visible in the screenshot containing a table with timestamp and screenshot path (e.g., Sheet 1 with entries like 20251016_174439 and screenshot paths). Useful for reconstructing the session metadata. Possible uri/name: context_log.numbers or context_log (path uncertain). (confidence: 4)

### Repos

### Folders
[0] autometrics-site — Root project folder open in VS Code (site for the AutoMetrics demo). (uri: autometrics-site/) (confidence: 8)

### Core Collaborators

### Other
[0] AutoMetrics demo (localhost) — Local web demo observed in the browser screenshots (upload/review flow with steps: Info, Upload, Process, Review). Accessible via http://localhost when running the project (port may vary). (confidence: 4)

## Next Steps
[0] Implement stepper/navigation skeleton in src/app/demo/page.tsx — create a Stepper/Breadcrumb component and manage a top-level currentStep state (Info, Upload, Process, Review). Lift parsed CSV data into page-level state (or React context) so Process and Review screens can access it. Add next()/back() handlers that: (a) navigate forward preserving downstream state; (b) navigate back without clearing state; and (c) when a new upload occurs, reset downstream state and set step=Upload. Include a small dev-only test or story (or simple integration/test file) that simulates uploading a CSV, navigating forward, going back, and doing a new upload to verify reset behavior. (confidence: 7)
[1] Implement CSV validation & in-app cleaning workflow — add validation functions (required columns, type checks, missing-value detection) and integrate them into the demo flow. Create a column-confirmation/mapping UI and inline row-edit controls (fill, drop, annotate) in src/app/demo/page.tsx or new components (e.g., src/components/CsvReview/*). Persist cleaned data into page-level state or context so the Process step consumes validated input. Add a small integration test that uploads the observed CSV (eval_metrics_...42.csv), demonstrates detecting blank ratings, applies a simple fix, and verifies Process uses corrected data.

I will discuss a selection of scientific results that have emerged from Marin, including the best open-source 32B model trained from scratch, rigorous benchmarking of optimizers and data-efficient training recipes. As we scale up, we hope that Marin can be a lab for the open research community to participate in the development of frontier AI.\n\n----------""","['<Proposition(id=2443, text=Michael Ryan has removed th…)>', '<Proposition(id=2444, text=Michael Ryan expresses a co…)>', '<Proposition(id=2445, text=Michael Ryan is actively en…)>', '<Proposition(id=2446, text=Michael Ryan is involved in…)>', ""<Proposition(id=2447, text=Michael Ryan's deletion of …)>"", '<Proposition(id=2448, text=Michael Ryan utilizes a dig…)>', '<Proposition(id=2449, text=Michael Ryan may struggle w…)>', '<Proposition(id=2450, text=Michael Ryan actively manag…)>', '<Proposition(id=2451, text=Michael Ryan exhibits a rea…)>', '<Proposition(id=2452, text=Michael Ryan effectively ut…)>']","# AutoMetrics Release

## Completed Objectives
None

## Suggestions
[0] Use a robust client-side CSV parser (e.g., PapaParse) and add parsing unit tests: integrate PapaParse into the demo's parseCsv workflow in src/app/demo/page.tsx to handle quoted fields, embedded newlines, custom delimiters, and streaming large files. Add a small test suite / fixtures (including the observed eval_metrics...42.csv or dev/survey/survey_responses.csv) that verifies correct row counts, preserved quoted/newline fields, and detection of blank/malformed cells. This will reduce parsing errors visible in the Review table and make validation/cleaning simpler. (confidence: 6)

## Notes
[0] Review table in the demo shows missing/blank rating cells in multiple rows after upload (visible in rows 0–4). The UI pagination displays ""Showing 1 to 5 of 21 entries"", indicating the uploaded CSV contains 21 rows. This supports adding validation/cleaning work for incomplete ratings. (confidence: 6)

(confidence: 5)
[2] Create CSV parsing test fixtures and unit tests: add a test file (e.g., tests/parseCsv.test.ts or tests/parseCsv.test.js) that exercises the demo's parseCsv workflow using fixtures dev/survey/survey_responses.csv and the observed eval_metrics_CoGymTravelOutcome_outcomeRating_42.csv (if available). The tests should verify correct row counts, preservation of quoted fields and embedded newlines, and detection/flagging of blank/malformed rating cells. If switching to PapaParse (suggested), include a small integration test that runs the parser on the fixtures and asserts expected output shape. (confidence: 6)
