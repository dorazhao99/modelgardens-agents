AutoMetrics Release,"Extract the CSV parsing logic from page.tsx into src/lib/parseCsv.ts with clear TypeScript types and edge-case handling, and add unit tests at src/tests/parseCsv.test.ts that cover missing headers, empty cells, extra columns, and inconsistent row lengths, then run and commit the tests.",10,9,9,9,38.0,0.95
Background Agents,"Edit dev/survey/objective_inducer.py to correct the induce_and_log signature (remove/rename the parameter named `str`), fix malformed default parameter annotations, ensure screenshot_path and user_name are accepted or derived from a safe context argument, convert complex fields using a centralized _to_plain serializer before json.dumps, and update induce_and_log to return the expected (res.goals, res.reasoning) with unit tests verifying both CSV output and returned tuple.",10,9,7,10,38.5,0.9625
Background Agents,"Create a unit test in dev/survey/tests/test_serialization_failure.py that constructs a synthetic observation containing nested model/ORM objects, calls the current induce_and_log pipeline (or the minimal CSV serialization routine), writes a temporary CSV row, and asserts the CSV contains nested JSON-encoded strings so we have a reproducible failing sample.",9,9,9,9,36.0,0.9
AutoMetrics Release,"Implement a robust parseCsv utility at src/lib/parseCsv.ts that validates CSV schema (required columns), handles missing/malformed values, returns a first-N rows preview, exposes helpful parse errors, and add unit tests with fixtures (tests/fixtures/{eval_metrics...,survey_responses.csv}) covering edge cases like missing values, extra/missing columns, and malformed rows.",10,9,10,10,38.5,0.9625
AutoMetrics Release,"Build the Review screen UI component (src/app/demo/ReviewStep.tsx) that renders parsed rows with pagination, supports inline edits with change-tracking, and provides an Export/Save action that downloads the edited CSV and updates in-memory session state, plus unit tests that assert the exported CSV matches applied edits.",10,8,9,10,37.0,0.925
AutoMetrics Release,"Implement the server-side Next.js API src/app/api/send-review/route.ts to accept uploaded CSV or session metadata, upload the CSV to the configured Cloud Storage path (emulator-aware), write a sessions/{sessionId} Firestore document with artifact metadata and status, return a generated private review link, include idempotency and robust error handling, and commit tests that use the emulators.",10,8,7,10,37.0,0.925
