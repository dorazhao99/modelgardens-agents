AutoMetrics Release,"Implement the demo step controller and breadcrumb navigation by editing src/app/demo/layout.tsx and wiring src/app/demo/page.tsx so the UI enforces Info → Upload → Process → Review steps, supports Back/Next, and persists the current step in the URL and localStorage for reload resilience.",10,9,8,10,38.5,0.9625
AutoMetrics Release,"Create an itemized ICLR revision plan at docs/iclr_revision_plan.md that lists each reviewer comment (use placeholders where text is missing), the required change (text/figure/experiment/demo), priority, suggested owner, and target completion date, then commit the file to a new branch rev/iclr-plan.",9,9,8,10,36.5,0.9125

AutoMetrics Release,"Produce a camera-ready LaTeX patch and response template: create overleaf_patch/ containing edited LaTeX snippets (suggested textual edits for abstract/methods/results), plus a reviewers_response_template.md that maps common reviewer points to manuscript locations and lists the experiments/figures needed; commit to branch release/overleaf-patch and open PR 'Prepare Overleaf patch and reviewer response template'.",10,8,10,10,37.0,0.925
AutoMetrics Release,"Create a new Git branch release/add-parseCsv-tests, add unit tests covering src/app/demo/page.tsx's parseCsv (edge cases: missing headers, extra columns, quoted fields, empty rows), fix any failing parsing behavior, commit changes, push the branch, and open a draft PR titled 'Add parseCsv unit tests and parsing fixes'.",9,9,9,9,36.0,0.9
AutoMetrics Release,"Implement step-based navigation state in src/app/demo/layout.tsx and src/app/demo/page.tsx to persist Info→Upload→Process→Review flow (using local state or URL/hash), add minimal UI breadcrumbs, verify locally at http://localhost, commit changes to branch release/demo-steps, and open a draft PR titled 'Finish demo step flow and breadcrumbs'.",9,9,8,9,36.0,0.9
