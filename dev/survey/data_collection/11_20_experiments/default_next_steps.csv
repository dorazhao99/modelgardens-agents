Commit message (one line):
""Temporarily guard Calendar import to avoid ImportError for users without Calendar backend""

PR description (short):
Temporary unblock: guard the Calendar import and skip calendar observer setup when Calendar is unavailable (or when PRECURSOR_DISABLE_CALENDAR is set). This avoids ImportError for users who don't have the upstream Calendar backend configured. This is intended as a short-term patch until the upstream GUM PR (pushed by Michael) is merged — revert/remove this guard once upstream is fixed. Tests: minimal smoke check described below.

One-line test instructions for Michelle / reviewer:
- Checkout the branch, run the usual final command to start/run precursor (the same command that previously raised the ImportError). Confirm no ImportError is thrown and that the rest of the system starts. Optionally set `PRECURSOR_DISABLE_CALENDAR=1` to force-disable and verify no calendar behavior is attempted.

- Collect recent logs/experiment highlights from the repo/HF dataset and produce a 3-bullet TL;DR of major findings and up to 5 representative failing examples (file paths or HF examples referenced).  
- Summarize annotation tool quick-start (URL from Slack, login hints, where to begin annotating).  
- Extract and highlight updated feature specs: list files dataset/dspy_task/task8635/feature*/feature.md and summarize the key changes (logging format & placement when verbose=True; ShortenInstruction must output PROPOSED INSTRUCTION: prefix, post-processing ordering, no LM kwarg mutation).  
- Note open technical issues to call out in meeting: git branch/remote sync error (local refs/heads/michael-dspy missing) and run_tests.sh Python detection bug (path: dataset/dsyp_task/task8394/run_tests.sh).  
- Produce deliverables and save under docs/meeting/: cotomata_onepager.pdf, cotomata_slides.pptx (3 slides), meeting_notes.md, and slack_message.txt (one-line Slack announcement + HF link + attachments).

Percy Rotation,19,Create the Stanford AI Seminar draft slides and exported PPTX: compile a 3-bullet speaking outline + 2 demo notes into PercyRotation/docs/PercyRotation_StanfordAI_Seminar_draft.md (use a simple markdown structure with speaker notes). Generate PercyRotation/docs/PercyRotation_StanfordAI_Seminar_draft.pptx from the markdown (via PercyRotation/tools/build_slides.py or pandoc/python-pptx). Include placeholders in the slides for Figure4 images (paths: PercyRotation/docs/figures/Figure4_*.png) and a citation slide referencing 'Completion ≠ Collaboration'. Save both the .md and .pptx in the docs folder and add a short README PercyRotation/docs/PercyRotation_StanfordAI_Seminar_README.md explaining how to rebuild the PPTX from markdown. This produces an editable slide source and a ready-to-present PPTX for the seminar.,6,597,2025-11-20 00:25:39
