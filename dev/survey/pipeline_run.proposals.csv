Cotomata,"Capture high-resolution screenshots and HTML snapshots of the Trajectory Comparison UI pages Final Patch (/final-patch), Merge Diff (/merge-diff), Test Output, and Agent Evaluation from http://localhost using headless Chromium/puppeteer, save them as docs/meeting/screenshots/final_patch_<timestamp>.png, merge_diff_<timestamp>.png, test_output_<timestamp>.png, agent_evaluation_<timestamp>.png and save HTML snapshots & a JSON metadata file docs/meeting/screenshots/metadata_<timestamp>.json that records URLs, timestamps, and viewport sizes.",This task is directly tied to the immediate meeting goal: the slides and one‑pager need high-quality UI screenshots. It is low-risk because it is read-only to the web UI and filesystem (saving artifacts); no external communication is required. Feasibility is high: the scratchpad shows a running local Trajectory Comparison UI (http://localhost) and there are suggestions to use puppeteer in docs/meeting/assemble.sh; the agent can install/run headless Chromium and capture snapshots. Alignment is excellent — the user explicitly prioritized capturing Final Patch / Test Output / Merge Diff screenshots for the Cotomata meeting.,9.0,9.0,10.0,10.0,36.5,0.9125,yes
Cotomata,"Populate docs/meeting/one-page.md by programmatically extracting the Final Patch diff (from the saved HTML snapshot or repository feature branch), listing files changed (from annotation.json), embedding the top test-output snippets (truncate to 6–10 lines), enumerating outstanding blockers (StreamResponse merge conflict, run_tests.sh detection, dspy cache issue), and writing three concrete next actions with suggested owners and due dates, then render this file to docs/meeting/one-page.pdf using reveal-md or pandoc and log the export step to docs/meeting/outputs/export_log.txt.","Creating the one‑pager is central to the meeting deliverables; it directly advances the top high-level goal. Safety is high but not perfect because it writes and renders files — those changes are reversible and intended as meeting artifacts. Feasibility is good: the scratchpad lists docs/meeting templates, annotation.json, and saved diffs; reveal-md/pandoc may require installing node/npm or pandoc, so the agent should verify availability or fall back to PDF generation options. This task matches the user's explicit request to produce a one‑page summary and export it quickly for the in‑progress meeting.",10.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,37.0,0.925,yes
Cotomata,"Create or finalize docs/meeting/assemble.sh to automate assembling meeting artifacts: check dependencies (node, reveal-md/pandoc, puppeteer), ingest the screenshots and docs/meeting/slides.md template, render docs/meeting/slides.pdf and docs/meeting/one-page.pdf, produce docs/meeting/slack_msg.txt (one-line decision + three action items + local file paths), and store all outputs in docs/meeting/outputs/<timestamp>/ with a small run log.","Automating assembly reduces manual overhead and ensures repeatable artifact production for meetings — a clear productivity win and aligned with the project's suggestions. Safety is reasonably low-risk but nonzero because the script will run various tools and write files; any install steps should be checking before executing. Feasibility is solid: templates and an assemble.sh are already proposed in the scratchpad, so finishing the script is mainly engineering work and packaging dependency checks. This matches the user's preference for lightweight automation and meeting-ready artifacts.",8.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,32.5,0.8125,no
Cotomata,"Create a safe git branch fix/run_tests-python-detection, apply the saved unified diff /Users/michaelryan/Documents/School/Stanford/Research/CodeConflictBenchmark/patches/run_tests_fix.diff to dataset/dspy_task/task8394/run_tests.sh, execute the updated run_tests.sh against available python binaries (python3.12, python3.11, python3.10, python3) to verify selection and venv creation, capture stdout/stderr to docs/repro/logs/run_tests_verify_<timestamp>.log, commit the change with an explanatory message, and open a draft PR with a verification checklist and attached logs (do not merge).",This task directly resolves a concrete bug and produces PR-ready artifacts and verification logs — high leverage for reproducibility and the meeting. Safety is moderate: creating branches and commits is normal but modifies repo state; the instruction to not merge and to create a safe branch mitigates risk. Feasibility is high because the scratchpad explicitly lists the saved unified diff path and the target file; the agent can run the test script against available python binaries and capture logs. This strongly aligns with the user's goals and past accepted/rejected agent tasks that indicate the user expects this kind of fix and verification.,9.0,9.0,7.0,10.0,36.5,0.9125,yes
Cotomata,"Author docs/scripts/setup_and_run.sh (and make ./repro.sh wrapper) that performs one-line reproducible setup: detect canonical dataset path (search for dataset/dspy_task vs dataset/dsyp_task), choose the first available Python >=3.10, create and activate .venv with that interpreter, install project dependencies from pyproject.toml, source .env.example into the environment for a dry-run, and run dataset/dspy_task/task8394/run_tests.sh while saving artifacts to docs/repro/artifacts/<timestamp>/; include --dry-run and --force options and a usage/help block.","A single reproducible wrapper is one of the project's explicit high-level goals and will materially improve onboarding and meeting reproducibility. Safety is moderate because running installs and test harnesses can modify environment and require network I/O; adding --dry-run and clear help mitigates risk. Feasibility is good: pyproject.toml and .env.example are present in the scratchpad, and detecting canonical path and choosing a Python executable are straightforward scripting tasks. This is tightly aligned with the user's desire for a one-line reproducible command and onboarding notes.",9.0,8.0,7.0,10.0,35.0,0.875,no
Cotomata,"Run the repository's test harness (tools/evaluate_parallel.sh or equivalent) against the feature branch feature1_feature2_k1 and capture full logs, generate a small summary CSV of test outcomes (pass/fail/time) and a bar/line plot showing per-test durations, save those plots to docs/meeting/test_debug/ and add a concise metrics summary file docs/meeting/test_debug/summary_<timestamp>.md describing top 5 failures and flaky tests.","Running the test harness and summarizing results provides important evidence for the one‑pager/slides and helps prioritize fixes; this is valuable to the meeting. Safety is moderate-low but the task involves running tests which can be resource- and time-consuming and may create many artifacts; documenting/outputting to a controlled folder reduces risk. Feasibility is plausible: tools/evaluate_parallel.sh is referenced in the scratchpad but with moderate confidence, so the agent should verify the script exists and adapt calls; generating CSV and plots is standard given test logs. The task is well-aligned with goals to capture test outputs and produce concise metrics for discussion.",8.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,31.0,0.775,no
Cotomata,"Reproduce the stanfordnlp/dspy '#8856 disabled cache still uses ram' bug by writing a minimal repro script under docs/diagnostics/dspy_cache_repro/repro.py, run scalene and tracemalloc to produce performance_profile.html and memory traces, save all profiler outputs and environment metadata to docs/diagnostics/dspy_cache_repro/<timestamp>/, and draft a short diagnosis docs/diagnostics/dspy_cache_repro/diagnosis.md with probable root causes and one or two candidate code-level fixes (e.g., bypass cache key computation when cache disabled).","Triage of this DSPy bug is a stated high-level goal and will produce high-value diagnostic artifacts and suggested fixes. Safety is high because profiling and writing diagnosis files are non-destructive; the main risk is resource use while profiling. Feasibility is medium: the scratchpad references the GitHub issue and an attached scalene profile, but reproducing the bug requires having the right dspy version and test inputs; the agent should check for installed tools (scalene/tracemalloc) and the dsp y package sources or pip install the correct version. This task aligns strongly with the goal to produce code-level triage and recommended fixes.",8.0,6.0,9.0,10.0,30.0,0.75,no
Cotomata,"Implement a non-invasive guardrail on a feature branch fix/precursor-drive-guardrails that adds a max_query_count, exponential backoff, and a warning/exit when Drive query limits are reached in src/precursor/main.py (preserve behavior behind a feature flag), add an automated regression test to src/precursor/test_agent_manager.py that reproduces the loop and validates the guardrail, run the tests and save logs to docs/diagnostics/drive_guardrails/<timestamp>/, and open a draft PR with test evidence and README notes.","This task addresses a concrete bug (agent repeatedly querying Google Drive) and would materially reduce flakiness and resource waste — high practical value. Safety is moderate: it modifies runtime code and tests, but using a feature flag and adding tests reduces risk and enables easy rollback. Feasibility is reasonable: the scratchpad shows src/precursor/main.py and test_agent_manager.py are present; writing a guardrail and a regression test is standard engineering work though it may require mocking Drive interactions and possibly credentials. The task fits the user's aim to add guardrails and regression tests before merging changes.",8.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,31.0,0.775,no
Cotomata,"Assemble draft Agent A and Agent B evaluation entries by parsing docs/meeting/annotation.json and the saved Final Patch/Test Output snapshots, generate docs/meeting/agent_evaluations.json with Plan Quality / Execution Quality / Plan-Execution Match numeric ratings and 3–5 sentence failure analyses for each agent that cite evidence file paths (e.g., docs/meeting/screenshots/final_patch_<timestamp>.png, docs/repro/logs/run_tests_verify_<timestamp>.log, diagnostics), save a screenshot/HTML snapshot of the filled Trajectory Comparison evaluation form to docs/meeting/screenshots/eval_saved_<timestamp>.png, and leave the forms as drafts (do not submit to external UI).","Filling the Agent A/B evaluation drafts is directly requested in the project's high-level goals and will provide material for meeting discussion and archival. Safety is high: creating draft JSON and local snapshots is read/write local work and explicitly requested to remain draft (no external submission). Feasibility is strong: annotation.json exists in the scratchpad and the Trajectory Comparison UI is available locally, so the agent can parse and assemble the evaluations and save screenshots. This precisely aligns with the user's wish to have evaluations ready to paste or include in meeting artifacts.",9.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,35.0,0.875,no
Cotomata,"Run a repository-wide path-audit to find occurrences of 'dspy' vs 'dsyp' (git ls-files | grep -Ei), write a report docs/repo/path_audit.md that lists files with mismatched spellings and the recommended canonical path, implement a small non-breaking helper script docs/scripts/canonical_dataset_path.sh that exports DATASET_PATH or creates a local symlink dataset/dspy_task -> dataset/dsyp_task if needed, commit these changes on a branch chore/standardize-paths, and include a note in docs/meeting/onboarding.md explaining the canonical path and the helper's usage.","Standardizing canonical paths prevents misapplied patches and broken scripts; it's lower immediate glamour but prevents real friction and is explicitly recommended in the notes. Safety is high: the changes are non-destructive (audit, helper script, symlink option) and can be done on a chore branch; adding docs is harmless. Feasibility is high: searching git ls-files and creating a small helper script or symlink is straightforward and the scratchpad explicitly points to inconsistent spellings. This is well-aligned with the user's suggested repository hygiene and onboarding goals.",7.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,32.0,0.8,no
