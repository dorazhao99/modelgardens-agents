Cotomata,"Capture high-resolution screenshots and HTML snapshots of the Trajectory Comparison UI pages Final Patch (/final-patch), Merge Diff (/merge-diff), Test Output, and Agent Evaluation from http://localhost using headless Chromium/puppeteer, save them as docs/meeting/screenshots/final_patch_<timestamp>.png, merge_diff_<timestamp>.png, test_output_<timestamp>.png, agent_evaluation_<timestamp>.png and save HTML snapshots & a JSON metadata file docs/meeting/screenshots/metadata_<timestamp>.json that records URLs, timestamps, and viewport sizes.",This task is directly tied to the immediate meeting goal: the slides and one‑pager need high-quality UI screenshots. It is low-risk because it is read-only to the web UI and filesystem (saving artifacts); no external communication is required. Feasibility is high: the scratchpad shows a running local Trajectory Comparison UI (http://localhost) and there are suggestions to use puppeteer in docs/meeting/assemble.sh; the agent can install/run headless Chromium and capture snapshots. Alignment is excellent — the user explicitly prioritized capturing Final Patch / Test Output / Merge Diff screenshots for the Cotomata meeting.,9.0,9.0,10.0,10.0,36.5,0.9125,yes
Cotomata,"Populate docs/meeting/one-page.md by programmatically extracting the Final Patch diff (from the saved HTML snapshot or repository feature branch), listing files changed (from annotation.json), embedding the top test-output snippets (truncate to 6–10 lines), enumerating outstanding blockers (StreamResponse merge conflict, run_tests.sh detection, dspy cache issue), and writing three concrete next actions with suggested owners and due dates, then render this file to docs/meeting/one-page.pdf using reveal-md or pandoc and log the export step to docs/meeting/outputs/export_log.txt.","Creating the one‑pager is central to the meeting deliverables; it directly advances the top high-level goal. Safety is high but not perfect because it writes and renders files — those changes are reversible and intended as meeting artifacts. Feasibility is good: the scratchpad lists docs/meeting templates, annotation.json, and saved diffs; reveal-md/pandoc may require installing node/npm or pandoc, so the agent should verify availability or fall back to PDF generation options.

Cotomata,"Create or finalize docs/meeting/assemble.sh to automate assembling meeting artifacts: check dependencies (node, reveal-md/pandoc, puppeteer), ingest the screenshots and docs/meeting/slides.md template, render docs/meeting/slides.pdf and docs/meeting/one-page.pdf, produce docs/meeting/slack_msg.txt (one-line decision + three action items + local file paths), and store all outputs in docs/meeting/outputs/<timestamp>/ with a small run log.","Automating assembly reduces manual overhead and ensures repeatable artifact production for meetings — a clear productivity win and aligned with the project's suggestions. Safety is reasonably low-risk but nonzero because the script will run various tools and write files; any install steps should be checking before executing. Feasibility is solid: templates and an assemble.sh are already proposed in the scratchpad, so finishing the script is mainly engineering work and packaging dependency checks.

Safety is moderate: creating branches and commits is normal but modifies repo state; the instruction to not merge and to create a safe branch mitigates risk. Feasibility is high because the scratchpad explicitly lists the saved unified diff path and the target file; the agent can run the test script against available python binaries and capture logs. This strongly aligns with the user's goals and past accepted/rejected agent tasks that indicate the user expects this kind of fix and verification.,9.0,9.0,7.0,10.0,36.5,0.9125,yes

Safety is moderate-low but the task involves running tests which can be resource- and time-consuming and may create many artifacts; documenting/outputting to a controlled folder reduces risk. Feasibility is plausible: tools/evaluate_parallel.sh is referenced in the scratchpad but with moderate confidence, so the agent should verify the script exists and adapt calls; generating CSV and plots is standard given test logs.

Safety is high because profiling and writing diagnosis files are non-destructive; the main risk is resource use while profiling. Feasibility is medium: the scratchpad references the GitHub issue and an attached scalene profile, but reproducing the bug requires having the right dspy version and test inputs; the agent should check for installed tools (scalene/tracemalloc) and the dsp y package sources or pip install the correct version.

Safety is moderate: it modifies runtime code and tests, but using a feature flag and adding tests reduces risk and enables easy rollback. Feasibility is reasonable: the scratchpad shows src/precursor/main.py and test_agent_manager.py are present; writing a guardrail and a regression test is standard engineering work though it may require mocking Drive interactions and possibly credentials.

Safety is high: creating draft JSON and local snapshots is read/write local work and explicitly requested to remain draft (no external submission).

Safety is high: the changes are non-destructive (audit, helper script, symlink option) and can be done on a chore branch; adding docs is harmless. Feasibility is high: searching git ls-files and creating a small helper script or symlink is straightforward and the scratchpad explicitly points to inconsistent spellings.

It is low-risk because it is additive (introducing mocks and injection points) and can be implemented with backwards-compatible defaults so production behavior is unchanged. Feasibility is high: the scratchpad already references telemetry/notification sinks and similar mocks in accepted/completed objectives, so the repository likely has the right spots to add injection.

Background Agents (Precursor),"Add a lightweight in-memory pending-agent-completed-task tracker in src/precursor/managers/agent_manager.py that records completed tasks (id, status, timestamps, retry_count), surfaces pending counts to the notification decision code, emits telemetry on retry/replay events, and include unit tests (tests/test_pending_task_tracker.py) demonstrating per-task max_retries and visibility to ui_manager's notification decision.","This task addresses a concrete blocker visible in the scratchpad (notifications being skipped or lost) and would meaningfully improve notification correctness — high value. It touches core runtime logic (agent_manager/notification decision) so it has moderate risk; however an in-memory tracker with clear tests is reversible and safe if feature-gated in tests. Feasibility is good because agent_manager.py is referenced in the scratchpad and the project already uses telemetry and notification sinks, but it requires careful integration to ensure counts are surfaced correctly.

It changes decision logic for tool dispatch, so there's moderate risk if done incorrectly, but defensive normalization plus telemetry and well-scoped loop-guards makes it reasonably safe. Feasibility is good: the repo contains mcp_loader and agent_manager code and there are existing repro logs to craft tests from.
