Background Agents,"Patch dev/survey/objective_inducer.py to remove debug returns, add input validation for None, implement a robust JSON-native serializer for nested objects, ensure CSV writing uses flat columns (no nested JSON strings), return the expected tuple (res.goals, res.reasoning), and add a concise docstring describing inputs/outputs and guaranteed return type.",10,8,8,10,37.0,0.925
AutoMetrics Release,"Refactor the inline CSV parser by adding a dedicated TypeScript parser module at src/lib/parser.ts that wraps PapaParse, exposes parseCsv(file, onProgress) with typed output and robust handling of quotes, escaped quotes, and embedded newlines, and replace calls in src/app/demo/page.tsx to use the new module.",9,9,9,10,36.5,0.9125
AutoMetrics Release,"Add comprehensive unit tests for the new parser at __tests__/parser.test.ts (Jest) and include fixture files under tests/fixtures/ (including tests/fixtures/sample_21_rows.csv) that cover edge cases: quoted fields, escaped quotes, embedded newlines, missing fields, and exact header preservation.",9,9,9,10,36.5,0.9125
Personalization Dataset Collection,"Create a one‑page IRB data‑sensitivity checklist (markdown) that includes a clear 'Do NOT create DB until:' gate with verification steps for encryption, IAM least‑privilege, backups, audit logging, consent/de‑identification, and include a short validation checklist to bring to the IRB meeting, saving it to GeneralUserModels/gum/docs/irb_packet/checklist.md",10,9,10,10,38.5,0.9625
Personalization Dataset Collection,"Draft a 5–8 slide IRB deck skeleton with speaker notes, a one-page executive summary, and a 3–5 minute speaking script and save them as markdown + a PPTX placeholder under GeneralUserModels/gum/docs/irb_packet/",10,8,9,10,37.0,0.925
Personalization Dataset Collection,"Draft a credentials lifecycle and rotation runbook (markdown) with step-by-step gcloud/console commands to rotate the exposed NEXT_PUBLIC API key, apply API key referrer/IP restrictions, provision a least‑privilege service account, and integrate Secret Manager into CI, saving it to infra/firestore/credentials.md with an executable checklist",9,9,8,10,36.5,0.9125
Personalization Dataset Collection,"Draft a one-page IRB data-sensitivity checklist and 'Do NOT create DB until' gate saved to GeneralUserModels/gum/docs/irb_packet/checklist.md that enumerates exact verification steps (IAM least-privilege checks, encryption/transit confirmation, backup/restore test steps, SMTP verification, key rotation requirements) and the precise console/gcloud commands or screenshot instructions needed to prove each item.",10,9,10,10,38.5,0.9625
Personalization Dataset Collection,"Generate a 5–8 slide deck skeleton plus a one-page executive summary and a 3–5 minute speaker script (saved as GeneralUserModels/gum/docs/irb_packet/{slides.md,summary.md,script.md}) covering objectives, methodology, participant protections/consent plan, technical security appendix, current metrics/status, open questions, and next steps.",10,9,10,10,38.5,0.9625
Personalization Dataset Collection,"Draft a credentials-rotation and Secret Manager runbook (GeneralUserModels/gum/docs/credentials_rotation.md) containing exact gcloud commands and verification steps to rotate the exposed Firebase API key, create and bind a least-privilege service account for ingestion, and store/retrieve secrets from Secret Manager without embedding them in client code.",9,9,9,10,36.5,0.9125
AutoMetrics Release,"Create a feature branch that updates src/firebase.ts to add the missing SDK imports/exports, enable WebChannel long-polling/fallback, add an env-controlled verbose-dev logging flag (print auth UID and Firestore error objects), and include unit/integration tests that run against the Firebase emulator.",10,8,8,9,36.5,0.9125
AutoMetrics Release,"Add repository hygiene: create .env.local.example with placeholder NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_* values, add .env.local to .gitignore, implement scripts/check-secrets.sh that scans staged files for common key patterns, wire the script into a Husky pre-commit hook, and add a GitHub Actions secret-scan workflow (.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml).",9,9,8,10,36.5,0.9125
AutoMetrics Release,"Create a reusable CSV parser module at src/lib/csvParser.ts that uses PapaParse, exports a typed parseCsv(file|string) API, and add unit tests __tests__/csvParser.test.ts covering quotes, escaped quotes, embedded newlines, and exact header preservation.",9,9,9,9,36.0,0.9
