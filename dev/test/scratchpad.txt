# AutoMetrics Release

Working on a website demo, polishing the overleaf, responding to ICLR reviews, and running some final experiments for the AutoMetrics paper.

## Ongoing Objectives
[0] Implement step-based demo UI and breadcrumb navigation: add step state and navigation covering Info → Upload → Process → Review in src/app/demo/page.tsx and supporting components; wire file upload to CSV parsing, show processing progress on the Process screen, render parsed CSV in Review with clear error handling, and ensure UI/state persists correctly when navigating between steps. Evidence: VS Code open on src/app/demo/page.tsx showing a progress bar, statusMessages list rendering, and a notify-email input; local dev terminal shows the Next.js dev server compiling — indicates active work on these UI pieces. (confidence: 7)
[1] Initialize git and prepare demo deployment: run git init if missing, add a sensible .gitignore, commit current work, optionally create a remote (GitHub/GitLab), and add a minimal CI/deploy config (e.g., Vercel or Cloud Run/Cloud Run YAML). If backend/cloud services are required, note which GCP APIs/credentials are needed and add instructions to enable them. (Files to edit: repository root, CI config, README.) (confidence: 6)

None

## Suggestions
None

## Notes
[0] User is inspecting Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services (Enabled APIs, Library, Credentials). Likely preparing to enable or monitor GCP APIs/credentials needed for demo deployment; relevant to the 'Initialize git and prepare demo deployment' ongoing objective. (confidence: 6)
[1] Uploaded demo CSV preview shows 21 total entries (table footer: "Showing 1 to 5 of 21 entries"). Useful to record for test coverage and end-to-end processing expectations. (confidence: 8)
[2] Observed demo CSV column headers include: row_index, model_output_hash, agentRating, communicationRating, outcomeRating, Feasibility_and_Realism_Qwen3-32B — record these for test/validation mapping and to ensure parsing preserves header names exactly. (confidence: 8)

## Project Resources
### Files
[0] src/app/demo/page.tsx — Demo page implementation (open in editor). Contains CSV parsing code and TODOs for adding step-based UI, breadcrumb navigation, and wiring file upload → process → review flow. (uri guess: src/app/demo/page.tsx) (confidence: 8)
[1] package.json — Node project manifest (visible in file explorer). Contains dependencies and npm scripts useful for installing, testing, and deploying the demo; check this file when adding PapaParse, test runners, or CI deploy scripts. (uri guess: package.json) (confidence: 8)
[2] src/app/layout.tsx — App layout component (open in editor). Likely where global wrappers, navigation, or persistent state for the demo can be implemented (useful when adding breadcrumbs and step state). (uri guess: src/app/layout.tsx) (confidence: 7)
[3] setup.txt — project setup notes / instructions (uri guess: setup.txt). Contains developer-facing setup steps; useful for onboarding and deploy/run instructions. (confidence: 7)

### Repos
None

### Folders
[0] autometrics-site/ — Project root folder open in VS Code (Next.js demo site). Contains package.json, next.config.js, README.md, src/app/demo/page.tsx, globals.css, and other project files. (uri guess: autometrics-site/) (confidence: 8)

### Core Collaborators
None

### Other
[0] Local demo running at http://localhost — autometrics-site demo Upload page shows a "File uploaded" banner, CSV preview table, pagination, and a "Continue to Process" button (useful for manual testing of upload → process → review flow). (confidence: 8)
[1] Google Cloud Console — APIs & Services (Enabled APIs, Library, Credentials) browser tab open (useful for enabling/monitoring required GCP APIs and service account credentials needed for demo deployment). (confidence: 6)

## Next Steps
[0] Refactor CSV parsing: replace the current parseCsv in src/app/demo/page.tsx with a robust library (e.g., PapaParse), add unit tests covering quotes, escaped quotes, embedded newlines, and other edge cases, wire the file uploader to call the new parser, add progress reporting to the Process screen, and show clear parsing errors in the Review screen. Target test folder: __tests__ or src/__tests__. (files to edit: src/app/demo/page.tsx) (confidence: 4)
[1] Add an automated end-to-end test for the demo: use Playwright or Cypress to run the local demo at http://localhost, programmatically upload a representative CSV (the demo preview shows 21 rows), click the "Continue to Process" button, wait for the Process step to complete (or poll for a completion UI state), and assert that the Review screen renders the parsed table with the expected number of rows and key columns (e.g., agentRating, communicationRating). Suggested test file: tests/e2e/upload_process_review.test.ts (or tests/playwright/upload_process_review.spec.ts). If needed, add small test-only hooks in src/app/demo/page.tsx to expose process completion state for deterministic assertions. (confidence: 3)
